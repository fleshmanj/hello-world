# hello-world
first repos

Hey guys!

My name is Josh and I started programming using the arduino environment. My first real project i built an 8x8x8 blue led cube that is really popular on instructables.com. I knew that i couldnt buy one and so i decided to tackle the project . Truthfully i did not write the code myself but made open source code compatible for my needs. It really showed me just how much i did not know lol. Another project i completed was a remote start for my vehicle. The aftermarket ones that are availble for my RAV4 are close to $250 so i decided that i was was going to build one for cheaper. I managed to use the existing key fob and can now start my car by pressing the lock key at least 3 times within 3 seconds. I also borrowed the code for that project but highly modified it for my use. I want to find a project that i can start from scratch and be proud of.
